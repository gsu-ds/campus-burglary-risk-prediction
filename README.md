**Predictive Analysis for Campus Safety: Modeling Burglary Risk at Atlanta’s Major Universities**

## Abstract 

Routine Activity Theory teaches that “Crime requires a motivated offender, a suitable target, and the opportunity”. Per the 2024 U.S Census, the Atlanta Metropolitan area is the 8th largest Metropolitan area in the United States. This project focuses on analyzing burglaries and burglary related crime in areas around major college campuses in Atlanta, with the goal of forecasting risk levels and hotspots that are safety concerns for students. This study will analyze burglaries, and related crimes, within a 1-mile radius of 4 major campuses, Georgia State University, Georgia Tech, Clark Atlanta University, and Spelman College.  We will utilize the Atlanta Police Department’s (APD) Open Data Portal to access offense type and the time and coordinates of each offense. To ensure specificity and relevance, we will use spatial filters to only include
incidents that occur within a 1-mile radius of each campus, where we predict that students will be disproportionately impacted.


## 🧑‍🚀 Team

We are an student research team bringing together our technical expertise to build models aimed at reduucing burglary risk near Metro Atlanta college campuses.
